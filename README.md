# Interview Objective: Todo List Application

## Objective  
Create a Todo List application with the following minimum requirements:  
1. Ability to **fetch**, **create**, and **update** todo items.  
2. Display the todos with a **completion state**.  

## Plus Points  
- Implement **complete CRUD functionality** (Fetch, Create, Update, and Delete) within the interview session.
- Use proper type definition.  
- Use **custom hooks** to organize logic and improve code reusability.  

## Expected Deliverables  
1. A functional UI to display and manage the todo list.  
2. API integration to handle data fetching, creation, update, and optionally delete operations.  
3. Clean and modular code with reusable custom hooks.  

Good luck! ðŸš€
